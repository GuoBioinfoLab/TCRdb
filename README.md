# TCRdb(2.0): A comprehensive database of T-cell receptor sequences

<a href=''><img src='Homepage.png' align='right' height='250' /></a>

The unique features of TCRdb include: 
* Comprehensive and reliable sequences for TCR repertoire in different samples generated by a strict and uniform pipeline of TCRdb;  
* Powerful search function, allowing users to identify their interested TCR sequences in different conditions; 
* Categorized sample metadata, enabling comparison of TCRs in different sample types; 
* Interactive data visualization charts, describing the TCR repertoire in TCR diversity, length distribution and V-J gene utilization.

The TCRdb database is freely available at [https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCRdb/ ](https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCRdb/#/ )

## Newly Update
* A substantial increase in data volume, with the number of TCR samples growing from 8,265 to 19,701 and the number of TCR sequences expanding from 277 million to about 700 million
* Construction of the largest TCR reference in healthy samples, which contains 1,888 samples labeled as healthy controls from 40 published studies.
* New search function, supporting batch search.
* Redesigned download function

The latest TCRdb2.0 is freely available at [https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCRdb2.0/ ](https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCRdb2/#/ ) !!!!!
