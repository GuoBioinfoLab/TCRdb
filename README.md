# TCRdb: A comprehensive database of T-cell receptor sequences in various conditions 

<a href=''><img src='Homepage.png' align='right' height='250' /></a>

TCRdb contains more than 277 million highly reliable TCR sequences from over 8265 TCR-Seq samples across hundreds of tissues/clinical conditions/cell types. The unique features of TCRdb include: 
* Comprehensive and reliable sequences for TCR repertoire in different samples generated by a strict and uniform pipeline of TCRdb;  
* Powerful search function, allowing users to identify their interested TCR sequences in different conditions; 
* Categorized sample metadata, enabling comparison of TCRs in different sample types; 
* Interactive data visualization charts, describing the TCR repertoire in TCR diversity, length distribution and V-J gene utilization.

The TCRdb database is freely available at [https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCRdb/ ](https://guolab.wchscu.cn/TCRdb/#/ )
